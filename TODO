List of expected features:
0. define the interfaces
1. a graph of calculations and it's builder
2. ability to read mutliple input sources
3. output front-end interface
4. multi-core support while performing simultaneous calculations on graph
5. computation distributed across multiple macines
6. redundancy, load balancing of computations
7. thread-safe, low latency interface to the library
